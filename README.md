# Ki.KD

This is a Swift implementation of [KD](https://github.com/kixi-io/Ki.Docs/wiki/Ki-Data-(KD)). It is a work in progress. Currently we only support basic Ki Types (String, Char, Bool, Int, Long, Float, Double, Dec and nil.), but otherwise the full grammer (tags, values, attributes, annotations, etc.) is supported.
